# Travel Site

> Simple HTML/CSS/Javascript travel site (with somewhat dated design) built using Babel, Gulp, PostCSS and Webpack

This is a travel site of Brad Shiff's ["Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow" Course](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/).

It was a nice refresher on Gulp, git, mobile first and responsive design. ðŸ˜Š
